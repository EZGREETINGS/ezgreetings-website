                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>EZ Greetings is an automated greeting reminder service that helps you send personalized greetings to friends, family, and colleagues on important dates like birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays.</p>
                    <p>We believe that staying connected shouldn't require constant reminders and last-minute scrambles. With EZ Greetings, you set up your greetings once, and we handle the rest—delivering your personalized messages exactly when they're meant to be received.</p>

                    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                    <p>In our busy lives, it's easy to let important dates slip by. A forgotten birthday or missed anniversary can feel like a small thing, but these moments matter. They're opportunities to show the people in our lives that we're thinking of them.</p>
                    <p>EZ Greetings exists to help you maintain those connections effortlessly, ensuring that the people who matter most to you always know they're remembered.</p>
