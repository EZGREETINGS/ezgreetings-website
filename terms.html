            <h2>5. REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
            
            <h3>5.1 No Money-Back Guarantee</h3>
            <p>EZ Greetings does NOT offer free trials or satisfaction guarantees. All subscription fees are non-refundable once paid.</p>
            <p>By subscribing, you agree to pay for the full billing period, regardless of usage. You may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future charges, but past charges will not be refunded.</p>
            
            <h3>5.2 Why We Don't Offer Refunds</h3>
            <p>EZ Greetings is a usage-based messaging service with real costs (SMS fees, email infrastructure, etc.) incurred immediately upon service use. Unlike physical products, digital messaging services cannot be "returned" after use.</p>
            <p>Our pricing is intentionally low ($7 for the Starter Plan) to minimize financial risk when trying the service. We believe this low monthly cost provides a fair opportunity to evaluate EZ Greetings without requiring a refund guarantee.</p>
            
            <h3>5.3 Billing Error Exceptions</h3>
            <p>We DO provide refunds for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Duplicate charges (technical billing errors only)</li>
                <li>Unauthorized charges (account security breaches)</li>
                <li>Billing system errors (charged wrong amount)</li>
                <li>Subscription cancellation not processed (our system failure)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To request a refund for billing errors, contact <a href="mailto:support@ezgreetings.net">support@ezgreetings.net</a> within 30 days with transaction details.</p>
            
            <h3>5.4 Service Failure Exceptions</h3>
            <p>In rare cases of extended service outages (48+ consecutive hours of complete unavailability), we may offer prorated credits or refunds at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>This does not apply to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Partial outages or degraded service</li>
                <li>Scheduled maintenance windows</li>
                <li>Third-party service failures (SMS carriers, email providers, AWS, etc.)</li>
                <li>Individual message delivery failures</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5.5 Cancel Anytime</h3>
            <p>While we don't offer refunds for past charges, you may cancel your subscription at any time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cancel from Account Settings → Billing → Cancel Subscription</li>
                <li>Cancellation takes effect at end of current billing period</li>
                <li>You retain access until the period you paid for expires</li>
                <li>No cancellation fees or penalties</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you subscribe on January 1st and cancel on January 15th, you keep access until January 31st, but won't be charged February 1st.</p>
            
            <h3>5.6 Alternative to Refunds</h3>
            <p>Instead of a refund guarantee, we offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Month-to-month billing (no annual commitment)</li>
                <li>Cancel anytime (no penalties)</li>
                <li>Comprehensive demo and documentation on our website</li>
                <li>Transparent pricing with no hidden fees</li>
                <li>Responsive customer support (<a href="mailto:support@ezgreetings.net">support@ezgreetings.net</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe our low monthly pricing and cancel-anytime policy provide a fair, low-risk way to try EZ Greetings without needing a refund guarantee.</p>
            
            <h3>5.7 Disputes & Chargebacks</h3>
